## Conclusion
Neither are really private & secure. WhatsApp claims it is, even though some of their practices are really questionable. I'd personally say Discord is a bit less secure than WhatsApp, but the best is to just avoid both of them if possible.

## Alternatives
The two alternatives I'm mentioned here pass almost all the criteria listed in the table above, so go check them out!

Use [Element/Matrix](https://element.io/) instead of **Discord** - it's much safer as well as open source. Some people might say it's more like an alternative for Slack, but personally, I really think anyone who uses Discord will get used to it pretty quickly. It supports screen share, permissions, and much more, just like Discord does.

Use [Signal](https://signal.org) instead of **WhatsApp**. It's a great option for privacy and security. Just as Element for Discord, I think WhatsApp users shouldn't have that many problems switching to Signal. It has everything you need: voice messages, calls, notes and more. In addition to that, I'm really enjoying the theme options for Signal as well as the notes, a nice desktop client and a screen share feature. I'm unsure if I'd recommend the payment feature though - surely useful for basic stuff, but [Monero](https://www.getmonero.org/) is much safer from what I've heard.

Also, I'd recommend Element as a replacement of WhatsApp, but not Signal as a replacement for Discord - it's just lacking in advanced features such as permission management.

### Note
I've also heard about [Fosscord](https://fosscord.com/) as a Discord alternative, but as its development isn't completed yet and I'm unsure if it might get sued for using Discord's frontend or something, I can't really tell whether I'll use it or not.

Also, avoid [Guilded](https://www.guilded.gg/) because it has a bad [privacy rating]((https://tosdr.org/en/service/2646)) and it isn't fully open source.
