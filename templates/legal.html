<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I sometimes <i>need</i> to store data for technical reasons.
    In this case, I am doing my best to make it as private and secure as possible:
    personal information is usually encrypted/hashed and stored securely.

    The following exceptions describe <strong>what</strong> data is stored on <strong>which</strong> service.

        <summary>
            <strong>Sharing of information to 3rd parties (such as Discord) with your knowledge for account systems</strong>
        </summary>
        <ul>
            <li>REASON: To make "connect with Discord"-links work, we need to share the information which is needed to connect your account with Discord.</li>
            <li>PAGES: Various, usually those with "Login with Discord" buttons. Examples include NovaPort.</li>

<p>I simply - if not otherwise noted above - do not track or store anything about you.
    No need to trust me*, just take a look at <a href="https://github.com/nsde/web">this website's source code</a>.
</p>

<p>* <i>And yes, I am fully aware that I <strong>in theory (!)</strong> could run completely different code on my server, but I am not that kind of guy, seriously.</i></p>

<h3>Children's Information</h2>
<p>Another part of my priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. I encourage parents and
    guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity.</p>
