<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>I sometimes <i>need</i> to store data for technical reasons.
    In this case, I'm doing my best to make it as private and secure as possible:
    personal information is usually encrypted/hashed and stored securely.

    The following exceptions describe <strong>what</strong> data is stored on <strong>which</strong> service.
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/74113/do-i-have-to-hash-users-ip-addresses-when-i-log-them">Unhashed IP address</a></li>
        <li>I'm only using this data to prevent spam and DDoS attacks, I swear.</li>
        <li>Why unhashed? Because firstly, they can easily be <a href="https://iphashes.com/">cracked with some websites</a> and also, I need to blacklist them.</li>
        <li>Obviously, I won't use the IP to track you or to sell this data to anyone. It's just stored on my servers and not shared with anyone else.</li>
        <li>Here's a screenshot of me getting thousands of requests in just a few seconds:</li>
